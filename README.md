# CEM (work in progress)
Combinatorial Equilibrium Modelling

CEM is a novel approach for the form-finding of spatial equilibrium networks for given topologies and inner force constellations (compression/tension). It is developed by Patrick Ole Ohlbrock and Pierluigi D'Acunto at the chair of structural design at the ETH Zürich.
